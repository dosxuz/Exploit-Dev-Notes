# Processor modes

## Real-Address Mode

- This mode implements the programming environment of the intel 8086 processor with extensions. (such as the ability to switch to protected or system management mode).
- The processor is placed in real-address mode following power-up or a reset.
- DOS runs in Read-address Mode
- No virtual memory, no privilege rings, 16 bit mode


## Protected Mode

- This mode is the native state of the processor. Among the capabilities of protected mode is the ability to directly execute 'Read-Address mode' 8086 software in a protected, multi-tasking environment. This feature is called virtual-8086 mode, 
- Although it is not actually a processor mode.
- Virtual-8086 mode is actually a protected mode attribute that can be enable for any task.
- Virtual-8086 is just backwards compatibility
- Protected mode adds support for virtual memory and privilege rings.
- Modern OSes operate in protected mode


## System Management Mode

- This mode provides an operating system or executive with a transparent mechanism for implementing platform-specific functions such as power management and system security. The processor enter SMM when the external SMM interrupt pin (SMI#) is activated or an SMI is received from the advanced programmable interrupt controller (APIC)
- SMM has become a popular target for advanced rootkit discussions recently because access to SMM memory is locked so that neither rings 0 nor VMX hypervisors can access it. 
- This if VMX is more privileged than ring 0 (ring -1), SMM is more privileged than VMX (ring -2) because a hypervisor can't even read SMM memory


- When you restart the processor everything is in real-mode 
- **Long Mode** is the 64-bit mode

- Only way to get in and out of SMM is to use interrupt
