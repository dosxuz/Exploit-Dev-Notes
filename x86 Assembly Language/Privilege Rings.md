# Privilege Rings

- MULTICS was the first OS with support for hardware-enforced privilege rings
- x86's rings are also enforced by hardware 
- Normal programs execute in "ring 3" (userspace/usermode) and the privileged code executes in "ring 0" (kernelspace/kernelcode)
- The lower the ring number, the more privileged the code is
- In order to find the rings, we need to understand a capability called segmentation


## Paravirtualized Xen

(requires a modified Guest OS)
(Newest Xen instead uses hw VMX to be more privileged than OS kernel)

- The Guest OS is executed in ring 2

## Segmentation

- Segmentation provides mechanism for dividing the processor's addressable memory space (called the linear address space) into smaller protected address spaces called segments.
